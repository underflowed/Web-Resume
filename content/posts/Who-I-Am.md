My name is Jose Oliver, I was born in Columbia to a single mother who was a Cuban immigrant.

I've always had a keen interest in technology, since I was very young, I always wondered what made the applications I used everyday tick, all the random flashgames, video games like minecraft, facebook, etc.
 
```python
#Ever since I wrote my first line of python code on my free time in 2016
#I knew that making a career out of this would be all I wanted
#Amazing that all it took was one line of code!
print("Hello world!") #elegant at that!
```
I am constantly learning and improving on my skills, I am currently enrolled in Columbus State University, and I am a stones throw away from completing my bachelors in Computer Science, but even then I know the learning doesn't end there.

There are endless technologies being developed and the learning portion of a career in software development never really seems to stop, and that excites me unendingly.

I will always be ready to take on a new challenge, a new technology to learn, a new problem to solve, nothing makes me happier.
