          Text adventure game written in Rust.#https://github.com/underflowed/text-adventure-game-in-rust
This project was done in an attempt to learn Mozillas rust programming language, I also learned some interesting concepts involving storing objects in matrices
let mut map: Vec&amp;lt;Vec&amp;lt;Option&amp;lt;Box&amp;lt;dyn Room&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; = vec![ vec![ Some(Box::new(EntranceRoom {})), ], vec![ Some(Box::new(AxeRoom{})), Some(Box::new(BodyRoom {})), Some(Box::new(DarkRoom {})), ] ]; Storing room structs in the map as a way of maneuvering in 2D space was interesting concept to implement.

          My name is Jose Oliver, I was born in Columbia to a single mother who was a Cuban immigrant.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a keen interest in technology, since I was very young, I always wondered what made the applications I used everyday tick, all the random flashgames, video games like minecraft, facebook, etc.
#Ever since I wrote my first line of python code on my free time in 2016 #I knew that making a career out of this would be all I wanted #Amazing that all it took was one line of code!
